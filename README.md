# Unsupervised Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Image Clustering Based on Adaptive Density

This repo contains my implementation of our paper "Unsupervised Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Image Clustering Based on Adaptive Density". 

### Implementation
The codes were originally adopted from "Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks" in science 2014. I heavily modified the matlab implementation to speed up and modified the parameter settings and algorithm framework based on our paper.
